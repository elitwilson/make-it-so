## Changelog (v0.3.4)

- Implement temp file context passing to free up stdin for Deno related operations and plugin authors.

### Added

- Whitelist 'mis' command such that Deno/TS can always run this command without worrying about permissions.

### Fixed

- Update cargo.toml version to 0.3.2

- Relax localhost permissions such that it's not blacklisted

- Update api and types to introduce user-defined TConfig interface for strongly typing config.toml custom user vars
