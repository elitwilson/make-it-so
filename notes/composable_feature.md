# ðŸ§© Plugin Composition Spec (Draft)

This document outlines a proposed mechanism for enabling **safe, automated plugin composition** in the `Make It So` CLI framework.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

To support plugin orchestration via:
- âœ… CLI wizards
- âœ… Codegen of orchestrator `.ts` files
- âœ… Workflow validation and discoverability

...we need plugins to **declare their inputs and outputs** in a standard format.

---

## ðŸ§± Goals

- Make plugin **I/O contract-based** and **introspectable**
- Enable the CLI to **validate and connect compatible plugins**
- Allow generation of **orchestrator plugins** from declarative recipes
- Provide guardrails to avoid invalid plugin chaining

---

## ðŸ§© Proposed TOML Format Extensions

### Example

```toml
[plugin]
name = "git-utils"
version = "0.1.0"

[commands.bumpSemver]
description = "Bump Git version tag"
script = "./bumpSemver.ts"

[commands.bumpSemver.outputs]
version = "string"

[commands.deploy.inputs]
version = "string"
ðŸ›  Supported Types

Primitive types:

    string

    boolean

    integer

    float

Structured types (future):
[types.BuildArtifact]
fields.name = "string"
fields.path = "string"
fields.checksum = "string"

[commands.build.outputs]
artifact = "BuildArtifact"

[commands.upload.inputs]
artifact = "BuildArtifact"
ðŸ”„ Composition Logic

    CLI parses all plugin.toml files

    For each plugin command:

        Capture its declared inputs and outputs

    For composition (e.g. wizard or codegen):

        Match compatible input/output keys and types

        Auto-generate orchestrator .ts plugins or pipeline suggestions

ðŸ’¬ Example Workflow (CLI Wizard)
? Select initial plugin: git-utils:bumpSemver
âœ” Produces: version (string)

? Compatible next step: [campsites:deploy]
âœ” Accepts: version (string)

? Name your orchestrator plugin: release:shipIt
â†’ Plugin created at .makeitso/plugins/release/shipIt.ts
ðŸ§ª Runtime Considerations

    Plugins must output JSON in PluginResult format

    Outputs must include keys declared in plugin.toml

    CLI can validate contract violations (missing output, bad type, etc.)

ðŸš« Out of Scope (for now)

    Dynamic runtime type coercion

    Multiple output variants (union types)

    Conditional flows or plugins with side-channel state

ðŸ“Œ Summary

This spec introduces a forward-looking system for composable plugin metadata.
It is not required today, but it unlocks:

    Scaffolding of complex workflows

    Wizard-driven plugin orchestration

    Safer plugin re-use via declarative I/O

Letâ€™s keep plugins composable, introspectable, and clean.

ðŸ§  Future You will thank you.
